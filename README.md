# Codey-Runs
A vanilla javascript game made using canvas.
Loved making this game using vanilla js, learnt a lot of stuff and made myslef familar with js as a language and not something that i use only on browser. 
Learnt a lot about how classes and functions work in js along with a lot of canvas api implemeentations and user interactivity.
This is a single level,onetime play game but can be built upon a lot.
To win get more than 20 points in the given time. 
Have fun playing!!!
